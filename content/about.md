# About me

Thanks for dropping by! Around the Internet, I go by rayhem and it's very nice to have you here. I'm a physicist by both temperament and training and I've since become a software engineer with a little skill in system design and math-heavy problems. I've got no shortage of guff on everything from hammocks to educational pedagogy. I may also tend to ramble a bit.

# What you'll find here

I honestly don't know! People tell me I have interesting thoughts and articulate them well, so I figured I could stand to write them down (mostly for my own clarity, but also as something of a preservative journal and maybe even an art piece).
 
\[
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c \log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) + KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}
\]
